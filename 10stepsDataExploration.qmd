title: "Zuur, Ieno & Elphick's 10 steps for data exploration"
---

This page is a reproducible exploration of "[A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2009.00001.x)" by Alain F. Zuur, Elena N. Ieno and Chris S. Elphick.

The 10 steps are all first presented in figure 1 of the paper:

![The 10 steps for data exploration.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/890dd91b-444e-430b-b41b-c7edee6653fb/mee3_1_f1.gif){alt="The 10 steps for data exploration." fig-align="center"}

In this paper, the authors first warn against "data dredging", which is when the patterns explored and discovered during data exploration influence data analysis unhealthily. Modeling and testing decisions should be determined a priori, using knowledge of the system and not a posteriori after exploration of the data. When understanding is limited, we can use exploration to help generate hypotheses, but that is fundamentally different from the principled workflow of this paper. Then, the authors warn against certain tests and visual tools, including normality tests.

#### Accessing data and code for reproducibility

Let's first load the relevant packages for this analysis.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Necessary packages from original code
library(lattice)

# Other additionnal packages to improve upon the provided code
library(here)
```

Unlike in the more recent 2016 paper, the data here is only accessible via a [zip archive on the paper webpage](Step 8: Are observations of the response variable independent?). Download the archive to `data/archive` and extract it to `data/zuur_ieno_elphick_2010`.

Again, the authors provide custom functions that need to be sourced. Like in the 2016 paper, they suggest about that code that "It is perhaps better not to try and understand what it all does"...

```{r}
source(here("data", "zuur_ieno_elphick_2010", "HighstatLib.r"))
```

### Step 1: Formulate hypotheses, carry out experiments and data collection

See the other page on this website for an example in the case of regression analyses.

### Step 2: Are there outliers in Y and X?

### Step 3: Do we have homogeneity of variance?

### Step 4: Are the data normally distributed?

### Step 5: Are there lots of zeros in the data?

### Step 6: Is there collinearity among the covariates?

### Step 7: What are the relationships between Y and X variables?

### Step 8: Should we consider interactions?

### Step 9: Are observations of the response variable independent?

### Step 10: Apply statistical model

See the other page on this website for an example in the case of regression analyses.
