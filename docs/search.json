Ieno.\nThe 10 steps are all first presented in figure 1 of the paper:\n\n\n\nThe 10 steps\n\n\nThe focus of the 10 steps on on linear modelling of the type GLM, GLMM etc and uses R although it generalizes to other languages. In order to access the data and code, which we will reproduce here.\nIdeally we would use a package like rdryad to do so, but I have been getting nowhere with any of its functions. It is probably broken as it is soon to be superseded by the deposits package. If I forget to update this website with the latest deposits API, feel free the file an issue.\nIn the meantime, let’s download the files one by one.\n\n# Create the file urls and destination files names & names\nbase_dryad_url &lt;- \"https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/\"\nfile_url_list &lt;- paste0(base_dryad_url, c(37547:37550))\nfiles_names &lt;- c(\"monkeys.txt\", \"owls.txt\", \"oystercatchers.txt\", \"zurr_iena_2016.R\")\nfiles_paths_list &lt;- paste0(c(rep(\"data/\", 3), \"scripts/\"), files_names)\n\n# If the file exists already, do not download it\nret &lt;- mapply(\\(file_url, file_path) {\n  if (!file.exists(file_path)) download.file(file_url, destfile =  file_path)\n}, file_url_list, files_paths_list)\n\nYou can take a look at the code in the data/Now, let’s load the data properly\n\nStep 1: State appropriate questions\n\n\nStep 2: Visualize the experimental design\n\n\nStep 3: Conduct data exploration\n\n\nStep 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data\n\n\nStep 5: Present the statistical model\n\n\nStep 6: Fit the model\n\n\nStep 7: Validate the model\n\n\nStep 8: Interpret and present the numerical output of the model\n\n\nStep 9: Create a visual representation of the model\n\n\nStep 10: Simulate from the model"
