In order to access the data and code, which we will reproduce here.\nIdeally we would use a package like rdryad to do so, but I have been getting nowhere with any of its functions. It is probably broken as it is soon to be superseded by the deposits package. If I forget to update this website with the latest deposits API, feel free the file an issue on the github repo that contains the source for this webpage.\nIn the meantime, let’s download the files one by one.\n\nbase_dryad_url &lt;- \"https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/\"\nfile_list &lt;- paste0(base_dryad_url, c(37547:37550))\nfiles_names &lt;- c(\"monkeys.txt\", \"owls.txt\", \"oystercatchers.txt\", \"code.txt\")\nfiles_names_list &lt;- paste0(\"data/\", files_names)\nmapply(\\(file_name, file_path) {\n  if (!file.exists(file_path)) download.file(file_name, destfile =  file_path)\n}, file_list, files_names_list)\n\n$`https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/37547`\nNULL\n\n$`https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/37548`\nNULL\n\n$`https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/37549`\nNULL\n\n$`https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/37550`\nNULL\n\n\n\nStep 1: State appropriate questions\n\n\nStep 2: Visualize the experimental design\n\n\nStep 3: Conduct data exploration\n\n\nStep 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data\n\n\nStep 5: Present the statistical model\n\n\nStep 6: Fit the model\n\n\nStep 7: Validate the model\n\n\nStep 8: Interpret and present the numerical output of the model\n\n\nStep 9: Create a visual representation of the model\n\n\nStep 10: Simulate from the model"
