title: "Zuur & Ieno's 10 steps"
---

This website in a reproducible exploration of "[A protocol for conducting and presenting results of regression-type analyses](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12577)" by Alain F. Zuur, and Elena N. Ieno.

The 10 steps are all first presented in figure 1 of the paper:

![The 10 steps](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/17c3d76c-f2e6-4e2a-a117-581a303cdaef/mee312577-fig-0001-m.png){fig-align="center"}

The focus of the 10 steps on on linear modelling of the type **GLM, GLMM** etc and uses R although it generalizes to other languages.

#### Accessing data and code for reproducibility

The paper provides data and code on Dryad but is not set up for interactive report-style reproducibility with package versioning (see the end of this section for a note about package age). To fix that, I used a quarto document with `renv` to produce this website. In order to reproduce the analysis here, you can clone [the repository](https://github.com/VLucet/ZuurIeno10steps) in [RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#new-rstudio-project-via-git), install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package, run `renv::restore()` and you should be good to go for running the quarto notebook!

In order to access the data and code, we would ideally use a package like [`rdryad`](https://github.com/ropensci/rdryad) to do so, but I have been getting nowhere with it. It is probably broken as it is soon to be superseded by the [`deposits`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/deposits) package. If I forget to update this website with the latest [`deposits` API](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/deposits/issues/41), feel free the [file an issue](https://github.com/VLucet/ZuurIeno10steps/issues).

In the meantime, let's download the files one by one.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Create the file urls and destination files names & names
base_dryad_url <- "https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/"
file_url_list <- paste0(base_dryad_url, c(37547:37550))
files_names <- c("monkeys.txt", "owls.txt", "oystercatchers.txt", "zurr_iena_2016.R")
files_paths_list <- paste0(c(rep("data/", 3), "scripts/"), files_names)

# If the file exists already, do not download it
ret <- mapply(\(file_url, file_path) {
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) download.file(file_url, destfile =  file_path)
}, file_url_list, files_paths_list)
```

You can take a look at the code in the scripts directory, we will be copying code from there into this document. Now, let's load the data properly before we get anything else done.

```{r}
library(here)
Owls <- read.table(here("data", "owls.txt"), 
                   header = TRUE,
                   dec = ".")
names(Owls)
str(Owls)
head(Owls)
```

```{r}
Monkeys <- read.table(here("data", "monkeys.txt"), 
                      header = TRUE)
names(Monkeys)
str(Monkeys)
head(Monkeys)
```

```{r}
OC <- read.table(here("data", "oystercatchers.txt"), 
                 header = TRUE,
                 dec = ".")
names(OC)
str(OC)
head(OC)
```

Finally, the load the required packages. Packages `maptools` and `rgdal` are deprecated as far as I can tell, and `sp` is just not recommendable for forward compatibility in 2024. We will attempt to update the spatial code.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Necessary packages
library(lattice)  
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)

# Recommended by the authors but outdated
# library(maptools)
# library(sp)
# library(rgdal)
```

### Step 1: State appropriate questions

The key idea is to have the salient question of the analysis in mind at the start, and formulate them properly. The example here is a study on the "vocal behavior of barn owl siblings" with a N = 28. Number of calls is sampled with microphone and the hypothesis is that food availability will influence that. Half the nests get extra food (treatment: satiated) and the other half is starved (treatment: deprived ; surprisingly no control?).

The 3 covariates are *time*, *food treatment (satiated or deprived)* and *sex of parent.* The question is :

-   Does the relationship between sibling negotiation and sex of the parent differ with food treatment, and does the effect of time on sibling negotiation differ with food treatment?

Note that the question contains the 3 terms and expected interactions.

The authors warn against breaking down the questions into smaller questions such as "Is there an effect of sex of the parent?", as "A potential problem with this approach is that the residuals of one model may show patterns when compared with the covariates not used in that model, which invalidates the model assumptions."

I find this a little surprising because I was taught to build simple models before complex ones, and would naturally work with simpler single covariate models first. The middle ground is probably where the first model you build is a result of a reasoning around the "simplest DAG".

### Step 2: Visualize the experimental design

### Step 3: Conduct data exploration

### Step 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data

### Step 5: Present the statistical model

### Step 6: Fit the model

### Step 7: Validate the model

### Step 8: Interpret and present the numerical output of the model

### Step 9: Create a visual representation of the model

### Step 10: Simulate from the model
