title: "Zuur & Ieno's 10 steps"
---

This website in a reproducible exploration of "[A protocol for conducting and presenting results of regression-type analyses](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12577)" by Alain F. Zuur, and Elena N. Ieno.

The 10 steps are all first presented in figure 1 of the paper:

![The 10 steps](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/17c3d76c-f2e6-4e2a-a117-581a303cdaef/mee312577-fig-0001-m.png){fig-align="center"}

The focus of the 10 steps on on linear modelling of the type **GLM, GLMM** etc and uses R although it generalizes to other languages.

#### Accessing data and code for reproducibility

The paper provides data and code on Dryad but is not set up for interactive report-style reproducibility with package versioning. To fox that, I used a quarto document with `renv` to produce this website. In order to reproduce the analysis here, you can clone [the repository](https://github.com/VLucet/ZuurIeno10steps) in [RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#new-rstudio-project-via-git), install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package, run `renv::restore()` and you should be good to go for running the quarto notebook!

In order to access the data and code, we would ideally use a package like [`rdryad`](https://github.com/ropensci/rdryad) to do so, but I have been getting nowhere with it. It is probably broken as it is soon to be superseded by the [`deposits`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/deposits) package. If I forget to update this website with the latest [`deposits` API](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/deposits/issues/41), feel free the [file an issue](https://github.com/VLucet/ZuurIeno10steps/issues).

In the meantime, let's download the files one by one.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Create the file urls and destination files names & names
base_dryad_url <- "https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/"
file_url_list <- paste0(base_dryad_url, c(37547:37550))
files_names <- c("monkeys.txt", "owls.txt", "oystercatchers.txt", "zurr_iena_2016.R")
files_paths_list <- paste0(c(rep("data/", 3), "scripts/"), files_names)

# If the file exists already, do not download it
ret <- mapply(\(file_url, file_path) {
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) download.file(file_url, destfile =  file_path)
}, file_url_list, files_paths_list)
```

You can take a look at the code in the scripts directory, we will be copying code from there into this document. Now, let's load the data properly before we get anything else done.

```{r}
library(here)
Owls <- read.table(here("data", "owls.txt"), 
                   header = TRUE,
                   dec = ".")
names(Owls)
str(Owls)
head(Owls)
```

```{r}
Monkeys <- read.table(here("data", "monkeys.txt"), 
                      header = TRUE)
names(Monkeys)
str(Monkeys)
head(Monkeys)
```

```{r}
OC <- read.table(here("data", "oystercatchers.txt"), 
                 header = TRUE,
                 dec = ".")
names(OC)
str(OC)
head(OC)
```

### Step 1: State appropriate questions

### Step 2: Visualize the experimental design

### Step 3: Conduct data exploration

### Step 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data

### Step 5: Present the statistical model

### Step 6: Fit the model

### Step 7: Validate the model

### Step 8: Interpret and present the numerical output of the model

### Step 9: Create a visual representation of the model

### Step 10: Simulate from the model
