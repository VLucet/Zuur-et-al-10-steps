This website in an exploration of "[A protocol for conducting and presenting results of regression-type analyses](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12577)" by Alain F. Zuur, and Elena N. Ieno.

The 10 steps are all first presented in figure 1 of the paper:

![The 10 steps](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/17c3d76c-f2e6-4e2a-a117-581a303cdaef/mee312577-fig-0001-m.png){fig-align="center"}

The focus of the 10 steps on on linear modelling of the type **GLM, GLMM** etc and uses R although it generalizes to other languages.

### Step 1: State appropriate questions

### Step 2: Visualize the experimental design

### Step 3: Conduct data exploration

### Step 4: Identify the dependency structure in the data

### Step 5: Present the statistical model

### Step 6: Fit the model

### Step 7: Validate the model

### Step 8: Interpret and present the numerical output of the model

### Step 9: Create a visual representation of the model

### Step 10: Simulate from the model
